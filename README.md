# Hero-Villian-Classification-in-Memes

This was a study project aimed at learning basic concepts in Natural Language Porcessing, especially Sentiment Analysis. 

## The project

The project aim was closely based on the Constraint 2022 (https://www.lcs2.in/CONSTRAINT-2022/) project on Hero-Villian classification in memes. 
Given online memes and corresponding OCR texts, we had to perform a semantic sentiment classification of the entities. In simple words, the objective was to identify Hero , Villian and Neutral parties in the memes using different NLP techniques. 

Our methodology and code closely referred to the paper by Shaik Fharook et. al. which is attached in the repository. All credits for the same go to the authors of that paper. This project was simply to explore NLP and learn how to implement techniques in practice.

## Code

The jupyter notebooks, complete with the code walkthrough and explanations can be found in the repository.
